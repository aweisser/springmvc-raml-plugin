Analysis:

Dependencies to org.raml (java-raml-parser)

- Module springmvc-raml-plugin only has two dependencies
    - Only the top level object of a raml file (type org.raml.model.Raml) is used here.

- Module springmvc-raml-parser is highly coupled to
    - org.raml.model (nearly all dependencies to this package)
    - org.raml.emmitter (very few)
    - org.raml.parser (very few)


Approach:

I'd suggest to decouple the springmvc-raml-parser from the third party java-raml-parser
by introducing an abstraction layer (interfaces) and adapters to java-raml-parser v1 and v2 (raml0.8) and later v2 (raml1.0).

For additional raml 1.0 features we can use extensions to the generic interfaces.
This way we can leave the existing code as is with a high refactoring safety and robustness.
